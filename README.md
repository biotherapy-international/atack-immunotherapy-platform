## Overview

This repository outlines the scientific and immunological framework underlying the ATACK platform (Allogeneic Targeted Activated Cancer Killer Cells), a personalized allogeneic cellular immunotherapy approach developed within the field of translational tumor immunology.

ATACK represents an advanced development of earlier intentionally mismatched alloreactive killer cell approaches, previously referred to in scientific literature as IMAK.

## Conceptual Evolution: IMAK to ATACK

Earlier publications describe intentionally mismatched alloreactive immune effector mechanisms designed to target malignant cells through allogeneic immune recognition.

The ATACK platform incorporates an additional level of targeting precision through the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against predefined tumor associated antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of selected malignant cells.

This integration combines:

- allogeneic immune effector mechanisms  
- antibody guided targeting of tumor surface antigens  
- activation of immune mediated cytotoxic pathways  

The conceptual goal is to enhance selectivity and functional anti tumor immune activity while maintaining a personalized therapeutic strategy.

## Scientific Context

The framework integrates principles from:

- tumor immunology  
- alloreactivity and cellular therapy  
- antibody dependent immune targeting  
- translational cancer immunotherapy  

The biological rationale is grounded in published peer reviewed research.

These publications describe the conceptual and clinical foundation of intentionally mismatched allogeneic immunotherapy (IMAK), which later evolved into the ATACK platform incorporating monoclonal antibody-based targeting of predefined tumor-associated antigens.
